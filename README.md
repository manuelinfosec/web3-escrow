# Web3 Escrow

Escrow agreements are those kinds of agreements that involve the use of third parties that hold some form of assets or funds before they are transferred from one party to another. 

In escrow agreements, the third party, who is referred to as the escrow agent, holds the funds until both parties have performed their contractual requirements (condition precedents).
